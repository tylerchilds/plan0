# plan0

A poem on computer history

Before plan0 was plan1
Before plan1 was plan98
Before plan98 was plan9
Before plan9 was posix
Before posix was unix
In the end was irix
After irix was generic park

_congratulations, or sorry, if you're reading this, you're in charge now_

jurassic park broke open and you have two choices. you can either start a web server on 8080 yourself to get public back online or you can tame a deno.

should you tame a deno to get server.js back online, the code is in app.sh and can be run via the bourne shell by executing the following command

```
./app.sh
```

you're going to need a walkie talkie for the next phase of the game, but keep your voice down, other wise the raptors will hear you.

use your watch, but keep it on silent, for the love of what you live for.

stay safe. stay sane.
